> “A photograph is usually looked at - seldom looked into.”
<br /> - Ansel Adams, American Photographer

Do you have an eye for a photograph that can be looked INTO? After all, it’s said that everyone owns a camera. But it’s not enough to own it. To be a photographer, you must understand, appreciate and harness the power you hold!

SANKALAN 2021 presents ALACRITY’21 - a photography contest of DUCS, where you can not just showcase your talent, but give the world a detour of all the beautiful places your imagination takes you to, give others the taste of the moment they haven’t even lived.
