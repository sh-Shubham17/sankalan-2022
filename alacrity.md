> ‚ÄúIt is an illusion that photos are made with the camera‚Ä¶ they are made with the eye, heart, and head.‚Äù
<br /> - Henri Cartier-Bresson

Do you have an eye for a photograph that can be looked INTO? After all, it‚Äôs said that everyone owns a camera. But it‚Äôs not enough to own it. To be a photographer, you must understand, appreciate and harness the power you hold!

SANKALAN 2022 presents ALACRITY- A photography contest of DUCS, where you can not just showcase your talent, but give the world a detour of all the beautiful places your imagination takes you to, give others the taste of the moment they haven‚Äôt even lived. 
Just put your imagination in your clicks and let them do the talking.
</br>
Register yourself now! See you with your cameras. üì∏
