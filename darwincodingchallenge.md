Do you possess a unique hunger for knowledge, like Darwin?</br>
Are you truly evolved as a geek?</br>
Find your true self in the struggle for existence and be the semicolon of your statements.</br>

The idea behind this contest is to challenge contestants with a less popular language which they
will have to learn on the spot and then use that knowledge to solve a given problem.

Contestants will be provided the required documentation during the event to refer to while
solving the problem.

<h4>
bool Darwin::isWinner(Sankalan team){</br>
if(team.about == "Strongest" || team.about == "Most Intelligent")</br>
team.winnerStatus = false;</br>
else if(team.about == "Most Adaptable")<br/>
team.winnerStatus == true;</br>
return team.winnerStatus;
}
