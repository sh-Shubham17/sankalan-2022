It’s said that only a few people knew how to break into the Chakravyuh and come out of it.

Let’s put this to the test and see if you’re one of them. Let’s see if you have the potential to connect the dots and come out of our Chakravyuh before the time runs out!

Presenting another event of SANKALAN 2021 - CHAKRAVYUH’21 - an online Treasure Hunt.

In Chakravyuh, you won’t be competing just against the other competitors, but also against the time and your internet speed ;p
Chakravyuh puts to the test how dynamic you can be at figuring out if 2 + 2 equates to 4 or to 22 (well, if you get the metaphor right). Because it’s only when you can make sense out of the superficially random clues and head to the right answer that you are taken to the next level.
